# Gist backup script

This script will download all gist files to local directory ("gists" by default)

Pre-run
---

Run `npm install`

Run
---

Run `node bkp.js USERNAME PASSWORD`

If all went well, you'll see "gists" directory populated with directories named after gist IDs.
Why named from gist ID? - Because majority of people not filing descriptions upon opening new gist, thos gist are simply called 'Untitled'.
